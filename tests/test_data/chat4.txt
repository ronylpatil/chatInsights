08/11/23, 6:20 pm - +91 95974 43458: OpenAI 😅🤣
08/11/23, 6:21 pm - +91 96208 88890: What ?? 😎
17/08/22, 5:06 pm - You were added
08/11/23, 6:22 pm - +91 95974 43458: It's said in the screenshot itself bro 😅
08/11/23, 6:31 pm - +91 98198 59082: Damn. But this is so vague as a pricing tbhh. Will this cover model deployment and maintenance ? Also I find the pivot from building and deploying foundational models to designing boutique solutions quite interesting
08/11/23, 6:34 pm - +91 95974 43458: No wonder, why new AI companies arise amidst openAI api access. The pricing uhhh 😨😒 startups and mid level companies can't think it off
08/11/23, 6:38 pm - +91 96208 88890: Yes. Exclamation mark not question mark ! By mistake I put 🤣
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - +91 96208 88890: For all that openAI has launched till now, do we have alternate also ? Be it models, APIs whatever
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - +91 98198 59082: Honestly small cap companies don't make sense for open ai. They have an extremely expensive engineering team that's decorated enough to charge whatever they please. 

Also Idts it will affect startups a lot. Startups can add a lot more value to an ecosystem apart from the models, like anything from good ui's to custom dsl's to guide APIs (refer normal computing)
08/11/23, 6:41 pm - +91 95974 43458: Yes bro their target is companies with investor backup 😅
08/11/23, 6:44 pm - +91 98316 13620: Healthcare industry is a joke
08/11/23, 6:44 pm - +91 98316 13620: past 2 years  I have worked for some big names  and interacted with many
08/11/23, 6:44 pm - +91 98316 13620: They dont want data to leak, but on the other hand they sell their own data
08/11/23, 6:44 pm - +91 98316 13620: and especially the US medical system is corrupted to its core
08/11/23, 6:45 pm - +91 98198 59082: More truer words haven't been spoken
08/11/23, 6:46 pm - +91 95974 43458: Selling data is Data commissioning, bro. That's part of the business. Ur data is a lead to some industry.They might have mentioned in the agreement in smaller words 😅
08/11/23, 6:48 pm - +91 98316 13620: not mine per say but their own patients, they sell it to insurance companies
08/11/23, 6:48 pm - +91 98316 13620: so that they can leach
08/11/23, 6:50 pm - +91 95974 43458: Yes bro, thats what I m saying. For insurance companies, the data is a lead. For giving that data, they offer money to the company.
08/11/23, 6:51 pm - +91 95974 43458: In product companies, it happens a lot without users constent
08/11/23, 7:19 pm - +91 96736 47641: Link to this info plz
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - +91 87670 91009: Hello folks,

08/11/23, 8:00 pm - +91 75359 47422: Can anyone suggest any use case regarding LLM what can be built?

08/11/23, 8:01 pm - +91 93548 41168: which sector
08/11/23, 8:02 pm - +91 75359 47422: any sector will work just need few use cases
08/11/23, 8:03 pm - +91 93548 41168: Use ai/LLM for analysing financial ratios from budget and answering questions, providing feedbacks
08/11/23, 8:05 pm - +91 95974 43458: https://openai.com/form/custom-models
08/11/23, 8:08 pm - +91 75359 47422: any blog to read on this part?
08/11/23, 8:10 pm - +91 93548 41168: not sure. this one i thought when I was asked to find use cases 🥲rest chatgpt for the win.
08/11/23, 8:10 pm - +91 93548 41168: infact it'll provide better answers

08/11/23, 8:40 pm - +91 98198 59082: Should give you some idea about what and how to build it
08/11/23, 9:17 pm - +91 96869 66347: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:17 pm - +91 96869 66347: don't wish to diminish the achievements of OpenAI at all, GPT4 is a  modern marvel. However, some of the hype following the developer day is a bit out of hand. It's important to remain realistic on what we can achieve with tools.

08/11/23, 10:48 pm - +91 98316 13620: can someone explain, I have been too deep into a kaggle comp to understand what this is
08/11/23, 10:48 pm - +91 98316 13620: any short description or a link to some resources would be good
